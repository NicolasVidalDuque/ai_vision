Diegos correction:
    talking with Diego we noticed some classes where just innecesary.
    considered as passthrough's, they did nothing but call another method.

    Deleted: DataConverterClass and PoseLandmarkDetectorModule.

    Now the strategy will have the interface (abstract class) for these methods:
    - convertToBodyLandmark
    - drawPoseLandmarks
    - detect_pose
